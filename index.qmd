I would love to use this space to keep SOP's as well as links to the SDS's, maybe even notes from lab meetings, announcements, other relevent lab information.

## GitHub Set-up

* Click the green "use template" button to make a repository with this content.  Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn't work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch).
